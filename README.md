# Segmented-customers
This project involves customer segmentation of mall customers using unsupervised machine learning clustering, specifically focusing on demographics like income and age.

Highlights
- Customer segmentation identifies marketing groups.
- K-means clustering is utilized for creating segments.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand data.
- Visualizations are created to summarize clusters.
- The elbow method helps find the ideal number of clusters.
- Gender distribution analysis reveals insights on shopping behavior.
- Multivariate clustering provides a comprehensive view of relationships.

Key Insights
- Clustering Importance: Customer segmentation helps tailor marketing strategies by identifying distinct shopping groups, enhancing targeting efforts.
- Data Exploration: EDA reveals trends and distributions in demographics, crucial for understanding customer behavior prior to clustering.
- Effective Visuals: Visualizations provide clear insights into clusters, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp key findings and make informed decisions.
- Optimal Cluster Count: The elbow method indicates the ideal cluster number, suggesting that three clusters yield meaningful groupings for marketing strategies.
- Gender Influence: Gender analysis in spending scores shows significant differences, highlighting potential areas for targeted campaigns.
- Behavioral Patterns: High-income, high-spending clusters indicate ideal target markets for luxury brands, while low-income, high-spending clusters suggest different marketing approaches.
- Continual Improvement: Recommendations for ongoing analysis and merging customer data with spending habits can enhance future marketing strategies.
